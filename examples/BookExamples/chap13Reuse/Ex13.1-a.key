// This is an example from p.508 (the buggy version of the program)

// Apart from the obvious bug in the program, there is one difficulty in
// doing the proof: reasoning about the Java division. It is necessary
// to do a case distinction whether x>0 and then manually apply the
// taclets jdivToDiv and divSame. A saved proof is included for
// reference.
