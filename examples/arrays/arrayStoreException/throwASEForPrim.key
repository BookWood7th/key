This example demonstrates that an <tt>ArrayStoreException</tt> can be thrown 
by assigning arrays of incompatible primitive type to another. The
<tt>main</tt> method of <tt>ASEPrim</tt> will terminate abruptly due to an
<tt>ArrayStoreException</tt> and thus the proof must and does not
close. Exactly one goal is left open.
