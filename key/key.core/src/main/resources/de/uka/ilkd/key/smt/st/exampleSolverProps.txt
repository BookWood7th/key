# This is an examplary solver properties file. 
# To add a solver, specify a .props file such as this one in this directory and add the file's name to "defaultSolvers.txt".

# The solver's name. 
# Should be unique amongst all used solver properties files, otherwise it is renamed throughout the solver loading process.
# If no name is given, the solver will be called "SMT Solver" or a unique version of that (depending on the other solvers' names).
name=MathSAT

# Arbitrary information about the specified solver.
info=Some text.

# The cmd command used to start the solver process. Empty String by default, if the property is not specified.
# Can later be changed by the user in the settings.
# The current command can later be changed by the user in the settings.
command=startSolver

# The cmd parameters appended to the command when starting the solver program, e.g. "-in" and "-smt2".
# If the property is not specified, the params are an empty String by default. They can later be changed by the user in the settings.

# The version parameter appended to the command while starting the solver program in order to get its version.
# If the property is not specified, it is an empty String "". Note that this cannot be changed later by the user.
version=--version

# The minimum supported version of this solver. By default, this is an empty String.

# The delimiters used by the solver program in its stdout messages. Default value is the array {"\n", "\r"}.
delimiters=delimiter1,delimiter2,...

# The default solver process timeout as a long value. If the property is not set, it is -1 by default, meaning that the general SMT timeout is used.
# The current timeout can later be changed by the user in the settings.
timeout=-1

# True for solvers that support if-then-else terms, otherwise it should be false. If the property is not set, it is false by default.
ite=true/false

# The SMTHandlers used by this solver. 
# If the property is not specified, it is an empty list by default which leads to all handlers being used.
# Note that this property currently only takes effect if the ModularSMTLib2Translator class is used.
# The handlers' names are expected to be fully specified. Currently possible values of HANDLER_CLASS are for example: 
# BooleanConnectiveHandler, CastHandler, CastingFunctionsHandler, DefinedSymbolsHandler, FieldConstantHandler, InstanceOfHandler, ...
handlers=de.uka.ilkd.key.smt.newsmt2.HANDLER_CLASS,\
	...

# The fully specified class name of the SMTTranslator class used by the solver at hand. 
# Currently possible values for TRANSLATOR_CLASS:
# SmtLib2Translator (legacy solvers), ModularSMTLib2Translator
translatorClass=de.uka.ilkd.key.smt.TRANSLATOR_CLASS

# The message handler (see SolverSocket.MessageHandler) used by the solver socket for communication with this solver.
# Currently possible values: DEFAULT (as used by Z3), CVC4, CVC5, Z3CE
messageHandler=msg_handler_name
 		
# The preamble file's name (has to be in this same resource directory). 
# By default, the preamble.smt2 file is used.
preamble = specialPreamble.smt2

# If this is true, the solver is only usable in experimental mode. Generally, those are the solvers that still use the SmtLib2Translator instead of the ModularSMTLib2Translator. The property is false by default, if not specified.
