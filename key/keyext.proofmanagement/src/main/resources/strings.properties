check_settings_desc = enables check for consistent proof settings
check_dependency_desc = enables check for cyclic dependencies
check_missing_desc = enables check for unproven contracts
check_replay_desc = enables check whether all saved proofs can be replayed successfully
check_report_desc = writes the report to a HTML file at the given path

usage_merge = pm merge [--force] [--no-check] <bundle1> <bundle2> ... <output>

merge_force_desc = Tries to merge the proof bundles even if the files check fails (may rename some files). Use only if you know what you are doing!
merge_check_desc = Merges and performs a check if successful. The arguments are passed to check command.
