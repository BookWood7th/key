<body>

The classes in the package represent the structure of proofs
loaded from a file. They contain only the abstract representation,
e.g. terms are stored as unparsed strings and names are not bound to
their declarations.

These classes restrict the structure of proofs.  In constrast, the
abstract syntax nodes for proofs allow arbitrary S-lists.
